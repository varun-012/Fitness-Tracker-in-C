Hello

The Major thing which you should take seriously while you are in a Fitness journey is "Diet and Nutrition"

Macro Nutrients : Protein ->  Proteins are made up of chemical 'building blocks' called amino acids. 
                              Your body uses amino acids to build and repair muscles and bones and to make hormones and enzymes. 
                              They can also be used as an energy source.

                  Carbohydrates -> Carbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules.
                                   Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. 
                                   Glucose, or blood sugar, is the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs.
                                   
                  Fats ->  The body uses fat as a fuel source, and fat is the major storage form of energy in the body. 
                           Fat also has many other important functions in the body,
                           and a moderate amount is needed in the diet for good health.

                  Fiber -> Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that the body can't digest.
                            Fiber helps regulate the body's use of sugars, helping to keep hunger and blood sugar in check.

Micro Nutrients : Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals needed by the body in very small amounts. 
                  However, their impact on a body's health are critical, 
                  and deficiency in any of them can cause severe and even life-threatening conditions.

Supplements : Protein shakes, Mass Gainers, BCAA, Multivitamin, Fish oil, Creatine, etc.

All of these are required in recommended amounts for optimum Health.
