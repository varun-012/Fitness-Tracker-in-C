Hello 
Now let us know how to calculate calories of different foods
A weighing scale is suggested for this

For all the packed foods there will be a Nutritional label on the back of the pack, go through it thoroughly.
You can find almost all the details of the food item over there.
Example : 100g of of Lays contains 400kcal
          take the amount of lays you want to eat and measure it
          if the reading shows 50grams then you will get 200kcal from it.

If you do not find the Nutritional label behind the pack just search for the information of the item on Net.
 
For all the cooked food items like rotis, lentils, etc
Measure them before cooking, so that we can track the calories easily.

Note : Make sure to check your Maintenance calories Every week because it changes as your body weight changes.
